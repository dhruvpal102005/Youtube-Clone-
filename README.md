YouTube Clone Frontend
This project is a frontend clone of YouTube, created as part of my learning journey with Next.js. The primary objective is to explore and practice Next.js features such as routing, component structure, and UI development.

⚠️ Note: This project focuses solely on the frontend and does not include backend functionality or API integrations.

This project is intended purely for educational purposes and demonstrates the layout and navigation structure of YouTube.
